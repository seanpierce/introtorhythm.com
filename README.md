## (Yet Another) Intro To Rhythm Upgrade

This repository contains the latest production source for **Intro To Rhythm (I2R)**. This was codebase was developed to upgrade a previous version of introtorhythm.com. The goals of this upgrade are threefold:

1. **Update** platform versions to the latest stable releases  
2. **Modernize** existing features  
3. **Remove** deprecated or unnecessary legacy features

## What is Intro To Rhythm?

**Intro To Rhythm (I2R)** is a freeform mix series and live-streaming audio station that has been running since 2017.  
All episodes and content are created and owned by the contributing artists, produced exclusively for I2R.  

Beyond broadcasting, I2R supports open-source projects and the spirit of collaboration and experimentation.  
If you’re interested in building your own live-streaming station or podcast platform, feel free to explore the source code (MIT License).

## What's Changing?

In this upgrade:  

- **Frameworks**: Django `3.x → 6.x`, Vue `2.x → 3.x`
- **Dependencies**: Updated across the board
- **Typescript**: All `.js` will now be `.ts` (because I ~~hate~~ love myself)
- **Features**: Some deprecated features removed, core features modernized

---

### What's Staying

- **Streaming**: Live, pre-recorded, and syndicated shows  
- **Chat**: Rebuilt with Socket.io and typescript (moving away from Firebase)  
- **Content API**: Migrating from the existing custom solution (class-based views as API endpoints) to Django REST Framework + model serialization (easier to maintain and industry-standard)  
- **Automated scheduling**: Existing cron + Python script system remains, with room for improvements  

---

### What’s Leaving

- **Subscribers**: Email subscriptions haven’t been used in years. This may return in a more thoughtful, enhanced form later.  
- **Episodes**:  
  - Early on, I2R focused on pre-recorded episodes, but once live streaming became the core, episode traffic dropped off.  
  - Maintaining and hosting large audio files was costly and time-consuming, so the feature has been deprecated.  
  - That said, if I2R gains more consistent live programming, automated episode management could be revisited in the future.
