"""
Utilities for managing scheduled playback of pre-recorded shows.

Unlike the application's primary ezstream instance, which continuously
streams live programming, this module manages a separate, short-lived
ezstream process responsible for playing a scheduled recording.

The scheduler works by:

1. Looking up the current scheduled Show in the database.
2. Generating a temporary ezstream XML configuration.
3. Starting a dedicated ezstream process for that recording.
4. Tracking the process via a PID file.
5. Safely terminating any previous scheduler process before starting the next one.

This module is designed to be executed through an authenticated internal
API endpoint that is periodically invoked by cron.
